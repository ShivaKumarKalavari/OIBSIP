I'm excited to share my one of the project from my internship as a Java Development intern at Oasis Infobyte. I developed a console-based application that simulates the functionality of an ATM machine. 

Hereâ€™s an overview of what the application can do:
Login:
The application requires users to log in with a valid user ID and PIN before performing any operations. If the credentials are invalid, the system will prompt the user to try again.

Basic Operations:
- Transaction History: Displays the user's transaction history in chronological order.
- Withdraw: Checks the account balance to determine if there are sufficient funds for a withdrawal. If not, it notifies the user of the insufficient balance.
- Deposit: Allows users to deposit money into their account.
- Transfer: Manages transferring money from one account to another.
- Balance Check: Shows the user's current account balance.
- Quit: Logs out the user and ends the session.

The application continuously runs like a real ATM machine once started.
